# How to Check Discord Wrapped

Checking your Discord Wrapped is a great way to relive your memories from the past year.

## Is there an official way?

Sometimes Discord sends out a "Year in Review" email, but it's not as detailed as users often want. This is why "Discord Wrapped" tools are popular.

## The Best Way to Check

The most comprehensive way to check your Discord Wrapped is by analyzing your personal data package.

1.  **Request Data:** In Discord settings, request your data.
2.  **Download:** When the email arrives, download the zip file.
3.  **Upload:** Use a secure Discord Wrapped analyzer to view your stats.

Make sure to only use trusted sites to protect your privacy!
