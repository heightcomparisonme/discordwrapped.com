# See Discord Wrapped

Want to see your Discord Wrapped? Here is how you can visualize your chat history, voice time, and more.

## Steps to See Your Wrapped

To see your Discord Wrapped, you typically need to use a third-party service, as Discord does not automatically generate a year-in-review for everyone in the app itself.

1.  **Data Package:** Go to User Settings > Privacy & Safety > Request all of my data.
2.  **Wait:** It can take a few days for Discord to compile your data.
3.  **Analyze:** Use a tool like Discord Wrapped to parse the JSON files and see your stats.

## What Will You See?

-   Top friends you messaged.
-   Most used emojis.
-   Total time spent in voice channels.
-   Number of messages sent.
