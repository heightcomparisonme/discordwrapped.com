- 'jin' (人) meaning 'human'
- 'riki' (力) meaning 'power'
- 'sha' (車) meaning 'vehicle'

## Evolution of the Word

1. The original Japanese term 'jinrikisha' was shortened to 'ricksha' and later 'rickshaw' in English.
2. This abbreviated form became popular during the British colonial period.
3. The word spread across Asia and eventually became internationally recognized.

## Global Adoption

## Cultural Impact
