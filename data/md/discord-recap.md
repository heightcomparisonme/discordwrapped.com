# Discord Recap

A Discord Recap is essentially the same as Discord Wrapped. It's a summary of your yearly activity.

## What's in a Recap?

A recap highlights your major milestones on the platform.
-   **New Friends:** How many people you added.
-   **Server Joins:** New communities you explored.
-   **Activity Peaks:** What time of day you were most active.

## Official vs Unofficial

Discord sometimes releases an official "Recap" email, but the community-driven "Wrapped" tools often provide deeper insights into specific message counts and voice channel durations.
