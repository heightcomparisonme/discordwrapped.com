# How to Get to Discord Wrapped

Getting to your Discord Wrapped involves a few steps since it's not a native in-app feature.

## Navigation Guide

1.  **Open Discord Settings:** Click the gear icon near your username.
2.  **Privacy & Safety:** Navigate to this tab.
3.  **Request Data:** Scroll down to find "Request all of my data".
4.  **Wait for Email:** It may take up to 30 days, but usually it's much faster.
5.  **Download & Upload:** Follow the link in the email, download the package, and upload it to a Wrapped generator.

This is the only way to "get to" a detailed statistical breakdown of your year.
