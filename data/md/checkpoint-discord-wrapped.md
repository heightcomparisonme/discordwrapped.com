# Checkpoint Discord Wrapped

Discord Wrapped is a fun way to look back at your year on Discord. Many users look for a "checkpoint" to see their stats.

## What is a Discord Wrapped Checkpoint?

A checkpoint in the context of Discord Wrapped usually refers to a specific time or tool where you can generate your stats. Since Discord doesn't natively provide a "Wrapped" feature exactly like Spotify, third-party tools fill this gap.

## How to find your Checkpoint

1.  **Visit a trusted Discord Wrapped tool.**
2.  **Request your data package from Discord.** This is often the most reliable way to get accurate stats.
3.  **Upload your data** to the tool to visualize your year.
