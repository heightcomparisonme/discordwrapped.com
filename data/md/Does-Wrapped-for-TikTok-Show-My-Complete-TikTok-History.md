title: Does Wrapped for TikTok Show My Complete TikTok History?
description: >-
  Not entirely. TikTok's data export includes only the last 6-12 months of watch history, based on your usage. You'll see a specific cutoff date in your Wrapped, like "Since 01/01/2022 you've watched...". However, likes and comments are usually complete, so your Wrapped will display your full history of likes and comments.

# The Color of the Hottest Flame

When it comes to flames, their colors tell us a fascinating story about their temperature. The hottest flame you can observe burns with an intense blue color, but understanding why requires exploring the relationship between heat and light.

## Understanding Flame Colors

As flames get hotter, they progress through a predictable color spectrum:
- Red flames: ~600-800°C
- Orange flames: ~800-1,000°C
- Yellow flames: ~1,100-1,200°C
- White flames: ~1,300-1,500°C
- Blue flames: ~2,500-3,000°C

## The Hottest Flame

The hottest flame commonly observed is blue, reaching temperatures around 3,000°C (5,432°F). This occurs in:
- Properly adjusted Bunsen burners
- High-efficiency gas stoves
- Welding torches
- The core of a candle flame

## Why Blue is the Hottest

The blue color indicates:
- Complete combustion
- Highest energy release
- Most efficient burning process
- Maximum temperature achievement

## Factors Affecting Flame Color

Several elements influence flame color:
1. Fuel type
2. Oxygen availability
3. Combustion efficiency
4. Presence of different chemicals or metals

## Scientific Explanation

The blue color in the hottest flames comes from:
- High-energy molecular transitions
- Complete oxidation of hydrocarbons
- Maximum energy release during combustion
- Emission of short-wavelength light

## Practical Applications

Understanding flame colors is crucial in:
- Industrial processes
- Laboratory work
- Welding operations
- Gas appliance safety

## Safety Considerations

When working with high-temperature flames:
- Always use proper safety equipment
- Maintain proper ventilation
- Follow safety protocols
- Be aware of burn risks

Remember, while blue flames are indeed the hottest in normal combustion, some specialized applications can create even higher temperatures through other means, such as plasma or specialized industrial processes.
