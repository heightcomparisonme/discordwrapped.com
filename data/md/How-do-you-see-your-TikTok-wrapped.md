# Are You Taller When You Wake Up in the Morning?

Yes, you actually are taller when you wake up in the morning! This fascinating phenomenon is backed by science and occurs due to several natural processes in your body during sleep.

## Why Does This Happen?

Throughout the day, gravity compresses your spine as you stand, walk, and go about your activities. The cartilage discs between your vertebrae gradually compress, making you slightly shorter by evening. During sleep, when your body is in a horizontal position:

1. Your spine decompresses
2. The discs between vertebrae rehydrate
3. Gravity's effects are minimized

## How Much Taller Are You?

The average person is about:
- 1-2 centimeters (0.4-0.8 inches) taller in the morning
- This height difference is more noticeable in taller individuals
- The effect is most pronounced in young adults

## When Do You Return to Normal Height?

Your height gradually returns to its regular measurement throughout the day:
- Most compression occurs within the first hour of being upright
- By mid-afternoon, you're typically at your "normal" height
- The process repeats daily

## Factors That Influence This Effect

Several factors can affect how much height you gain overnight:
- Sleep duration
- Sleep position
- Age (younger people experience more variation)
- Overall spinal health
- Physical activity level

## Interesting Facts

- Astronauts in space can grow up to 3 inches taller due to the lack of gravity
- The effect is more pronounced after long periods of lying down
- This daily height variation is completely normal and healthy

Look for these options in the article editor and fill them out as needed.

## Syncing with GitHub

After saving or creating an article:

3. The `articles.json` file in the `data/json/` directory will also be updated to reflect the changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Saving**: Save your work frequently to prevent loss of content.
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent style across your articles for a professional look.
3. **Optimized Titles and Descriptions**: Write clear, SEO-friendly titles and descriptions.
4. **Image Optimization**: If including images, ensure they are optimized for web use.
5. **Proofreading**: Always proofread your articles before publishing.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while managing articles:

1. **Changes Not Saving**: Check your internet connection and try again. If the problem persists, try refreshing the page and re-entering your changes.
2. **Formatting Issues**: If your Markdown isn't rendering correctly, double-check your syntax.
3. **Sync Errors**: If changes aren't reflecting in GitHub, verify your GitHub token permissions and repository settings.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively manage articles on your TikTok Wrapped website through the admin panel. Remember, all your content is version-controlled through GitHub, allowing for easy tracking of changes and the ability to revert if necessary.
