# Discord Wrapped Where

Where can you find your Discord Wrapped?

## Finding the Feature

Discord does not have a "Wrapped" button right in the app like Spotify does. You won't find it in your user profile or settings menu directly as a feature you can just click to view instant stats.

## Where to look

1.  **Your Email:** Discord sometimes emails a recap. Search your inbox for "Discord" or "Year in Review".
2.  **Data Request:** The "where" is actually in your own data. You have to request it from Discord's privacy settings.
3.  **Third-Party Sites:** Once you have your data, you go to a site like `discordwrapped.com` (example) to visualize it.
