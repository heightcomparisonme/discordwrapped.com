# The Color of Airplane Black Boxes

Despite being commonly known as "black boxes," airplane flight recorders are actually painted bright orange or red. This distinctive coloring serves a crucial purpose in aviation safety and accident investigation.

## Why Are They Called Black Boxes?

The term "black box" is a bit of a misnomer. The nickname originated during World War II, referring to early flight recording devices that were housed in dark-colored boxes. The name stuck, even though the color changed significantly.

## The Actual Color and Its Purpose

1. **Bright Orange**: Modern flight recorders are painted a distinctive bright orange or international orange color.
2. **Reflective Strips**: They also feature reflective strips to enhance visibility.
3. **Purpose**: This vibrant coloring helps search teams locate the device among aircraft wreckage or in underwater searches.

## Components of Flight Recorders

There are typically two types of flight recorders:

1. **Flight Data Recorder (FDR)**
   - Records technical flight data
   - Painted bright orange
   - Located in the aircraft's tail section

2. **Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR)**
   - Records cockpit audio
   - Also painted bright orange
   - Usually placed near the FDR

## Design Features

The bright coloring is just one of several design features that help in recovery:

- Underwater Locator Beacon (ULB)
- Heat and impact resistant shell
- Waterproof construction
- High visibility paint
- Reflective strips

## International Standards

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates:

1. The bright orange/red color for all flight recorders
2. Reflective materials to assist in location
3. Specific placement on aircraft
4. Regular maintenance and inspection

## Historical Context

The evolution of flight recorder coloring:
- 1950s: Early black-colored units
- 1960s: Transition to orange coloring
- Present: Standardized bright orange/red with reflective elements

The bright orange color has proven invaluable in numerous aircraft accident investigations, making these critical devices easier to locate and retrieve, ultimately contributing to aviation safety improvements worldwide.
